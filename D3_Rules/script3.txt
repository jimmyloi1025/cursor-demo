Project Rules
- live in .cursor/rules, which is a file and version-controlled.
- used for encode domain-specific knowledge about our codebase
- automate project-specific workflows or templates
- standardize sype or architecture choice
- we can organize rules with directories 

Nested Rules
Placing rules in .cursor/rules directories throughout the specific project:
For example:
project/
  .cursor/rules/        # Project-wide rules
  backend/
    server/
      .cursor/rules/    # Backend-specific rules
  frontend/
    .cursor/rules/      # Frontend-specific rules
