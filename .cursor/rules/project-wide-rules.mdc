# Project Rules

## Security First
Always implement security best practices: validate inputs, use secure defaults, and log security events.

## Python Standards  
Use type hints for all functions, include docstrings, and follow async/await patterns for I/O operations.

## Documentation
Write clear, actionable commit messages and document all configuration options with examples.

## Error Handling
Implement comprehensive error handling with security context. Never expose internal details in error messages.

## Configuration Management
Use secure defaults for all configurations, support environment variables, and validate all config parameters.

## Testing & Validation
Include input validation examples and test security patterns. Provide working usage examples in all code.

## Code Organization
Structure code with dataclasses for data models, separate concerns into focused modules, and use consistent naming conventions.
