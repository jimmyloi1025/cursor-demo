# Active Context - Cursor Vibe Coding Demo

## Current Focus: VAN Mode Initialization

## Recent Changes
- Project workspace analyzed and structured
- Memory Bank system initialized
- Complexity level determined: LEVEL 3
- Core documentation files created

## Current Status
 **Phase**: VAN Mode (Initialization)
 **Complexity**: Level 3 - Multi-component orchestration
 **Objective**: Establish project foundation and transition to PLAN Mode

## Key Decisions Made
- **Complexity Assessment**: Level 3 due to integrated demo components
- **Memory Bank Structure**: Progressive documentation with detail-on-demand
- **Workflow**: VAN  PLAN  CREATIVE  IMPLEMENT  QA
- **Documentation**: Hierarchical rule loading for token optimization

## Next Steps
1. Complete VAN Mode initialization
2. Transition to PLAN Mode for strategy development
3. Analyze existing demo components
4. Develop implementation roadmap

## Active Considerations
- Integration complexity between demo components
- Security and compliance requirements
- Production-ready code standards
- Real-time learning capabilities
